# How We Got to Python / Why Programming Languages

# Data Types

Define each of the data types
- Int
- Float
- String object
- Boolean T/F

Using `type` 
- THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A STATEMENT

DISCUSS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CONSOLE, SHELL, and SCRIPT

INCLUDE PRELIMINARY BLOCKQUOTE ABOUT COMMENTS

## Comprehension Check

Console vs shell vs script

Int vs float

String vs Boolean

Specific examples:
- is `"7"` different than `7` (how)
- is `"True"` different than `True` (and how)

## Application

QX: Describe each data type in your own words and show an example

# Variables & Assignment Operators

Define variables
- What they are
- How we create them
- Simple vs composite

Python rules for variable names
- Start with letter or undescore
- Reserved words (MAKE A DOC WITH A LIST OF RESERVED TERMS)
- Meaningful variable names

Define assignment operator
- Connect to variables
- Simple vs composite

Checking variable type/contents:
- Reintroduce `type` this time with variable name
- Introduce `print` (primarily as way of showing variable value, we'll come back to it later/discuss in greater depth)

## Comprehension Check

What are variables, what do they do, how do we create them

Simple vs composite variables

Rules for variable names

What symbol is assignment operator in Python

## Application

Create named variable for each data type in Python using assignment operator

Check using `print` and `type`

Answers need to include assignment statement and print/type for each data type
- Int
- Float
- String object
- Boolean T/F

# Arithmetic Operators

Table of arithmetic operators (define them, show examples)
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Modulus
- Exponents
- Floor division

https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_arithmetic_operators.asp

Try stuff in console (raw output, using Python as a calculator)

Then connect into variables/assignment
- INTRODUCE LANGUAGE OF EXPRESSIONS

ALSO MENTION ORDER OF OPERATIONS (PEDMAS)

## Comprehension Check

Sample math problems, what would be correct output for....
- Modulus operator
- Exponent operator
- Integer/floor division
- Example that involves order of operations

Show example of arithmetic operator and assignment statement, what terms/concepts/statements apply to this
- Example of simple vs composite
- Expression/assignment/statement language
- Something about data type

## Application

Explain each / show example
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Modulus
- Exponents
- Floor division


Check comprehension text on `/` vs `//` with example

TEMPERATURE CONVERSION EQUATION (word problem)

Making change (from set amount)

# Concatenation

Introduce concept:
- Connect to assignment (simple vs composite)
- Reference the underlying logic
- Show the syntax
- Show how it works with different data types

Emphasize underlying logic- arithmetic operation (addition) vs concatenation

Syntax options for concatenation:
- `+` plus sign
- `,` comma
- Curly bracket syntax
- f/s syntax

## Comprehension Check

Difference between addition and concatenation
- Show example with different data types, what would be the output

Different syntax options
- Show example, what would be the output

## Application

QX: Variables for each of the pieces of a standard ND intro (name, year, majors/minors, hall), use concatenation to create the full introduction using any of the syntax options above

QX: Same prompt, but alternate workflow that creates sentences and prints concatenated sentences

# Input & Output (I/O)

Introduce concept:
- Connect with work we've done previously with CPU/memory simulators, and overarching principle of what computers "do" (take an input, do something with it, return that to user)
- Big picture all the different ways we see the concept at work in programming re inputs (user inputs, data, files, etc) and outputs (stored in program memory, show output in console/shell, create/save/modify files, other more complex tasks that can be part of output)

How we're thinking about I/O at this point
- A lot more to come with reading/writing files, but for now...
- `input()` and `print()`
- `print()` we've already seen
- Big picture what `input()` does (takes input, stores in program by assigning to variable)
  * `input()` quirks- STORES AS STRING
  * IF WE WANT TO CHANGE THIS.....introduce concept of converting data types, we'll come back to this

Example of putting it all together:
- Sample program where user inputs favorite color (string) and program outputs "Your favorite color" message

Different ways we can interact with variables and output:
- Concatenation
- Curly bracket syntax
- f/s syntax

## Comprehension Check

What does I/O stand for

What are some examples in a programming context

Programs that use input- what would we expect to have happen
- Addition and a string object (concatenation)
- Division and a string object (error)

## Application

QX: Favorite color message from user input "Your favorite color is")

QX: Standard ND intro with user inputs.

# Converting Data Types

EXAMPLE of trying to perform arithmetic operation on a string object

Describe this as a data type issue

As mentioned previously, default for input is string...We might want to change that

We might also run into data type errors 
- SHOW EXAMPLE OF DATA TYPE ERROR (message or specific example)

So also other scenarios where we need to change how Python is understanding a value/object

We can do that using specific functions:
- `int()`
- `str()`

Show a couple examples of both in action

## Comprehension Check

Programs that change data type- what would we expect to have happen
- Convert string input to number, arithmetic operation
- Try to convert string input (that's not a number) to a number, error message
- Concatenation with string number input and convert to number, concatenation

## Application

QX: Temperature conversion formula using user input

QX: Month/days/something time unit conversion

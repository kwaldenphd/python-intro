# How We Got to Python / Why Programming Languages

# Data Types

Define each of the data types
- Int
- Float
- String object
- Boolean T/F

Using `type` 
- THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A STATEMENT

DISCUSS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CONSOLE, SHELL, and SCRIPT

INCLUDE PRELIMINARY BLOCKQUOTE ABOUT COMMENTS

## Comprehension Check

## Application

# Variables & Assignment Operators

Define variables
- What they are
- How we create them
- Simple vs composite

Python rules for variable names
- Start with letter or undescore
- Reserved words (MAKE A DOC WITH A LIST OF RESERVED TERMS)
- Meaningful variable names

Define assignment operator
- Connect to variables
- Simple vs composite

Checking variable type/contents:
- Reintroduce `type` this time with variable name
- Introduce `print` (primarily as way of showing variable value, we'll come back to it later/discuss in greater depth)

## Comprehension Check

## Application

# Arithmetic Operators

Table of arithmetic operators (define them, show examples)

Try stuff in console (raw output, using Python as a calculator)

Then connect into variables/assignment
- INTRODUCE LANGUAGE OF EXPRESSIONS

## Comprehension Check

## Application

# Concatenation

Introduce concept:
- Connect to assignment (simple vs composite)
- Reference the underlying logic
- Show the syntax
- Show how it works with different data types

Emphasize underlying logic- arithmetic operation (addition) vs concatenation

## Comprehension Check

## Application

# Input & Output (I/O)

Introduce concept:
- Connect with work we've done previously with CPU/memory simulators, and overarching principle of what computers "do" (take an input, do something with it, return that to user)
- Big picture all the different ways we see the concept at work in programming re inputs (user inputs, data, files, etc) and outputs (stored in program memory, show output in console/shell, create/save/modify files, other more complex tasks that can be part of output)

How we're thinking about I/O at this point
- A lot more to come with reading/writing files, but for now...
- `input()` and `print()`
- `print()` we've already seen
- Big picture what `input()` does (takes input, stores in program by assigning to variable)
  * `input()` quirks- STORES AS STRING
  * IF WE WANT TO CHANGE THIS.....introduce concept of converting data types, we'll come back to this

Example of putting it all together:
- Sample program where user inputs favorite color (string) and program outputs "Your favorite color" message

Different ways we can interact with variables and output:
- Concatenation
- Curly bracket syntax
- f/s syntax

## Comprehension Check

## Application

# Converting Data Types

EXAMPLE of trying to perform arithmetic operation on a string object

Describe this as a data type issue

As mentioned previously, default for input is string...We might want to change that

We might also run into data type errors 
- SHOW EXAMPLE OF DATA TYPE ERROR (message or specific example)

So also other scenarios where we need to change how Python is understanding a value/object

We can do that using specific functions:
- `int()`
- `str()`

Show a couple examples of both in action

Q1: Create a named variable for each of the following data types.
- Integer
- Float
- String
- Boolean

Show the value of each variable using `print()` and check the type of each variable using `type()`.

Answer to this question includes program + comments that document process and explain your code.

"""
Q2: Write programs (or a single program) that use each of the following arithmetic operators at least once.
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Modulus
- Exponents

You can write separate calculations with single operators, or calculations that use multiple operators.

Q5: Create variables for each of the discrete pieces of information in "the standard Notre Dame introduction."
- Name
- Class year
- Home state/country
- Major(s) / minor(s)
- Residence hall

Use concatenation in combination with a `print()` statement to output a narrative introduction using the named variables.

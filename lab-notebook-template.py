Q1: Create a named variable for each of the following data types.
- Integer
- Float
- String
- Boolean

Show the value of each variable using `print()` and check the type of each variable using `type()`.

Q2: Write programs (or a single program) that use each of the following arithmetic operators.
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Modulus
- Exponents

You can write separate calculations with single operators, or calculations that use multiple operators.

Q4: Write a program that calculates the fewest number of U.S. coins needed to make change for a 73 cent remainder. To put that another way- write a program that determines the smallest number of coins in each U.S. denomination needed to make up 73 cents. Answer to this question includes program + comments that document process and explain your code.

In U.S. currency, one dollar ($1.00) equals one hundred (100) cents. The coins used to make change have a face value in cents.

- Quarter = 25 cents
- Dime = 10 cents
- Nickel = 5 cents
- Penny = 1 cent

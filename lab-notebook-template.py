"""Q1: What do you expect to see when you run the program? How does that compare to what happened when you ran the program?"""




"""Q2: Describe your experience and process building your own ASCII art. How did you approach the design process? What challenges did you encounter? Include your code as part of this answer."""




"""Q3: Describe a scenario or situation in which being able to use Boolean operators when programming in Python would be valuable. What kinds of tasks or programs would require Boolean operators? What would Boolean operators enable you to do?"""





"""Q4: Experiment with a range of basic arithmetic operations in Python. Write a program that involves arithmetic operation. Describe the process of writing this program. What did you want to do in Python? What were the program outputs? What challenges or unexpected results did you encounter? Include your program as part of the answer to this question."""




"""Q5: Write a program that asks the user to enter two words, and then prints the words concatenated together. Include your program as part of the answer to this question."""




"""Q6: Write a program that prompts the user to enter two numbers, converts the input values to integers, adds them, and reports the result. Answer to this question includes program + comments that document process and explain your code."""




"""Q7:  Write a program that asks the user to think of a month and then enter the number of days in that month. Your program should then compute the number of minutes in the month, and report the result. Answer to this question includes program + comments that document process and explain your code."""



  
"""Q8: Write a program that prompts the user to enter a temperature in Fahrenheit, and reports the equivalent temperature in Celsius. Answer to this question includes program + comments that document process and explain your code."""




"""Q9: Write a program that asks the user to input the amount of change your program is to make, and then compute the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies that produces the correct change with the fewest coins possible.
